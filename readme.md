# TipCalculator

This Tip Calculator is very simple and easy to use. You simply input the amount of the total bill, the quality of service you felt you received, and finish it off with entering how many people are splitting the bill, if any. The calculator will then display the total tip amount below.

## WIP
This project is 90% done. I need some QoL changes such as: having the 'each' pop up when more than 1 person is on the bill, I need to also have the button fire off constantly instead of having to restart the app everytime. There's probably more that I will need to fix as more testing is done with my family and friends.

## Project Photo

This is how the project should look if you were to clone this repo. Please let me know if you have any further questions about this repo.
